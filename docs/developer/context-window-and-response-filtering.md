# Context Window Management and Response Filtering

This guide explains how the system handles context window limitations and filters out unwanted content from LLM responses.

## What This Feature Does

The context window management and response filtering system:

1. **Manages conversation length** - Automatically handles long conversations that would exceed the model's token limit
2. **Cleans up responses** - Removes technical artifacts, error messages, and duplicated content
3. **Provides clear feedback** - Shows warnings when approaching context limits
4. **Ensures quality output** - Prevents garbled or broken responses

## User Benefits

### For End Users

- **Cleaner responses** - No more technical artifacts or error messages in responses
- **Longer conversations** - Ability to have lengthy chats without hitting context limits
- **Better error handling** - Clear, user-friendly messages when limits are reached
- **Consistent experience** - Same quality responses across different model types

### For Administrators

- **Reduced support issues** - Fewer user complaints about broken responses
- **Better resource utilization** - Optimized token usage and context management
- **Model-specific handling** - Each model family (Mistral, Llama, DeepSeek) gets specialized processing

## Automatic Features

The system automatically:

- Detects when conversations approach context limits
- Truncates conversation history intelligently when needed
- Adds explanatory notes when truncation occurs
- Filters out common garbage patterns from model outputs
- Provides warnings when context capacity is nearly full

## Configuration Options

Most settings work automatically, but administrators can configure:

- **Auto-truncation** - Enable/disable automatic conversation history truncation
- **Auto-filtering** - Enable/disable automatic response filtering

These can be configured in the administration panel under "Model Settings".

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

1. **"This conversation is too long" messages**
   - Start a new conversation
   - Delete older messages from the current conversation
   - Switch to a model with a larger context window

2. **Seeing context warnings frequently**
   - Consider using models with larger context windows
   - Encourage shorter, more focused conversations
   - Increase server resources if using quantized models (they have smaller contexts)

3. **Response is cut off mid-sentence**
   - This usually indicates the model reached its context limit
   - The system should add a note about this
   - Start a new conversation to continue

## For System Administrators

To ensure optimal performance:

- Monitor model memory usage in the admin dashboard
- Consider increasing context sizes for frequently used models if hardware allows
- Review system logs for context overflow patterns to identify bottlenecks
